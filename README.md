# React practice one

The intention of this exercise is write an app from scratch to production using tools/libraries I'd normally use.

## List of concepts and tools I use for this project
- React
- React Context for state management
- Sass for styling using the CSS module pattern
- React testing library
- CI/CD for pushing to remote & publishing to Netlify
